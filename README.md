BMIT - BattleTech Metadatabase Import Tool

Download and better Instructions here: https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/76?tab=description

This is a tool that reads the json mechdef,pilot,lance and vehicles files and updates the db.  This is to allow you to use custom mechs in the campaign.  If properly tagged they will show up as enemies during random contracts.

NOTE: You must make sure the csv contains your mechdefs and that they are properly formed (make sure they work in skirmish mode). Make sure they are working as you intend by testing them in Skirmish mode before attempting to import them using this tool.
